# -font-face-Generator

## Uses: 
This was made for taking two font directories and creating a list of @font-face rules using the contents
of each directory to dynamically output the listing.

## Future Plans
I built this really quickly to get through a problem but may have plans in the future to output all of the 
contents to an @font-face.css file.

That is all -- The End.
